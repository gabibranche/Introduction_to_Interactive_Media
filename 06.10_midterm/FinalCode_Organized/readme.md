# A note:

Dear Michael (and anyone else who might be reading this):

As I said in my reflection, I tried really hard to use what were learnt in class and original code to ensure that I truly understood the process and wasn't just relying on open source code. However, because of this I did this assignment quite haphazardly piecing together parts that I got to work as I went. This was very much reflected in the messiness of my code.

I acknowledge that while my code submitted on Wednesday was complete and did have the main comments... it was not well organized at all and the comments could use a lot of work. As such I decided to rearrange my code to be easier to follow.

I hope this is as helpful to you as it was to me 

Thanks!

Gabi
