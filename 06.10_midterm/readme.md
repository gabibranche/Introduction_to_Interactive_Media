# Midterm Project

## Synopsis

The task for the midterm was to create a game that uses everything we have learned so far

## What I did

I decided to improve my game done for assignment 5 - The ultimate Percy Jackson Matching Game.

The final game can be found [here](https://youtu.be/dx2TxDyScK8)

## Challenges

One of my biggest challenges were keeping track of all the variables as my code grew. This especiailly became an issue when i got an error. To overcome this I would often do a stepwise process of testing each function in order and seeing when the code breaks. I also did parts of the code in separate sketches and then added them to the main code adjusting as necessary once it was working independently.

Some of the coding challenges included: 
- getting the cards to display for a few seconds before being covered
- moving the cards to their new position
- shuffling the array without duplicating elements from the array 
- displaying certain pages/messages conditionally within draw

## Reflection 

This exercise really helped me see code more holistically. Looking back I would do well to comment more regularly so that I do not get lost within my own code. However, overall I tried to make the game and the code user friendly. I also made it a point of duty to try to figure out how each element of the game would work on my own with little to no openSource code. I thought this would make me better understand what I was trying to do and learn from my mistakes. 

All in all, taking into consideration the amount of time we had to complete the assignment, I am pretty pleased with the project.
