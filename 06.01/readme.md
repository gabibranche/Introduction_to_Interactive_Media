# Homework Assignment - June 1

## Synopsis:

Our assignment was to create a self-portrait of ourself using geometry in Processing. 

## What I did:

To complete this task I followed a series of steps:

- Step 1:

  - I chose a photograph of myself to use as a reference for my self portrait

- Step 2:

  - I sketched the portrait so I could have a clearer idea of how I would approach the drawing

-Step 3:

  - I broke down the drawing into basing geometric shapes that I knew I could apply to Processing

Step 4:

  - I made a referencer grid both on my drawing and on my processing Canvas to make mapping the shapes easier

Step 5:

  - I completed the portrait and added finishing touches

Step 6: The Final Product

  - I added a greenbackground to somewhat reflect the background of the original picture and cut off runover of the portraid by covering up with the same color as the background


## Challenges

The biggest challenge with this exercis was mainting my barings as I added more shapes. The origin point was different for different shapes but with patience and clear commenting I was able to keep track of which shapes went where. The grid also proved extremely useful in calculating where the coordinates went since I wanted to use 'width' and 'height' as much as possible to ensure that the piece was adjustable.

## Reflections

I liked this excersice although at points it was frustrating. It was a good test of creativity and adaptabilty. Given the time I would add to the background and want to look more into textFont for the sweater graphic
