## Final Project Proposal

## Synopsis: 

For my final project I would like to make a finger obstacle course. This course would use all the different sensors in various ways and require the user to navigate it from one end to the other. The elements of the course that I have in mind right now are as follows:

 - Dance Dance Revolution:
  - Using the four switches to create a set up similar to dance revolution except with your fingers dancing instead

- Slicer:
  - Using the servo motor to create a slicer that needs to be avoided
  
- High Ligt
  - Using the ultrasonic sensor to measure how high the a ball flies when propelled like a see saw
  
The Game would be reflected on the screen with the score and the different elements displaying based on which part of the course is being played
